# Users List

This project was a simple technical challenge from a React course I am taking.\
The idea behind it is to add users to a dynamic list storing the passed information about their name and age. Moreover, I implemented a delete button/method so we can exclude any desired user from the list displayed on the screen by its ID.
Here, I practiced my knowledge about React components, React states, React props, CSS styling, and more! I hope you enjoy :)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
